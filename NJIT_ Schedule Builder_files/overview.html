				<strong>How do I use this?</strong>
				<p>Basic overview on how to use this tool:</p>
				<p>
					To the right is an input box. Enter courses there (e.g., CS341). There is no
					course list or anything remotely similar. If you don't know what classes you want to take,
					look at the catalog. If you can't remember the numbers, look at the catalog.
				</p>
				<p>You can also search by starting the term with @ (e.g., '@FOUND OF COMPUTER').</p>
				<p>
					After a course has been selected, it gets added into the panel below the search box. A table
					of all available sections is shown for each course (the only information shown is the section number,
					instructor, and a comment icon, if there are any).
					Selecting a particular section will add that section to the time grid.
				</p>
				<strong>HELP... printing doesn't show all the days.</strong>
				<p>The resolution on your monitor is likely too high. Decrease the width of the window then go to <em>Print Preview</em>.</p>
				<p><em>Update:</em> printing should work across all browsers. Click on the print icon above the grid.</p>
				<strong>HELP... I can't find any schedules.</strong>
				<p>
					Either there are no possible schedules (unresolvable conflicts) or there are no
					possible schedules (you have a schedule picked).
					<br>
					The schedule finder only searches courses that have <em>NO</em> selected section.
					<br>
					To remove a section, remove the entire course or remove it from the grid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sections can also be removed by clicking on the <span class="ui-button ui-widget ui-icon ui-icon-trash"></span> button above the grid,
					which will clear <em>all</em> sections.
				</p>
				<strong>HELP... I can't remove a constraint.</strong>
				<p>Hover over the constraint on the left-side. An X will pop-up along the top-right corner. Click it.</p>
